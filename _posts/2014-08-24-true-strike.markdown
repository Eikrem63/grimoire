**Divination cantrip**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 30 feet

**Components**: S

**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 round

You extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your magic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your next turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target, provided that this spell hasn’t ended.
