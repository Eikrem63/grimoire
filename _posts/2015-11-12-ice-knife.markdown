**1st-level conjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: 60 feet

**Components**: S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)

**Duration**: Instantaneous

You create a shard of ice and fling it at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 piercing damage. Hit or miss, the shard then explodes. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the cold damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
