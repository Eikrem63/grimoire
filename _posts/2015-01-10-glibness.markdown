**8th-level transmutation**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V

**Duration**: 1 hour

Until the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can replace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what you say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth indicates that you are being truthful.
