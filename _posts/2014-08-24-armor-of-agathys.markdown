**1st-level abjuration**

**Casting Time**: 1 action

**Range**: Self

**Components**: V, S, M (a cup of water)

**Duration**: 1 hour

A protective magical force surrounds you, manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear. You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration. If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points, the creature takes 5 cold damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, both the temporary hit points and the cold damage increase by 5 for each slot level above 1st.
